# Data sets
1. ThermoSIM: 
    Two example data sets are given here. Critical temperature (critical-sim.txt) 
    and VLE density and surface tension (slab-sim.txt). These data are obtained
    from high-throughput molecular dynamics simulation.
    [Predicting thermodynamic properties of alkanes by high-throughput force field simulation and machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00407).
2. Public: Public data sets, as well as optimized hyperparameters.

3. RxnClassification: Chemical reaction classification.
   
    A small data set containing 3000 reactions that comes from [Development of a Novel Fingerprint for Chemical Reactions and Its Application to Large-Scale Reaction Classification and Similarity](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci5006614)
