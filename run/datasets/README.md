# Data sets
1. ThermoSIM: [Predicting thermodynamic properties of alkanes by high-throughput force field simulation and machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00407). 
Two example data sets are given here. Critical temperature (critical-sim.txt) 
and VLE density and surface tension (slab-sim.txt). These data are obtained
from high-throughput molecular dynamics simulation.

2. RxnClassification: [Development of a Novel Fingerprint for Chemical Reactions and Its Application to Large-Scale Reaction Classification and Similarity](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci5006614)
Chemical reaction classification.
